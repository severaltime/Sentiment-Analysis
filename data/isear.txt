During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and  talking secretly.  I do not know why I suspected them	 also  another classmate supported me.  He remembers that these people  had only one key in the key-ring	 this had seemed strange to him.   Besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling  books at a book-shop and they should not have had such books.  I  told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the  books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not  helped him as he stole later on also.  I felt guilty|1|
